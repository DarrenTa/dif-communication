# INVESTMENT Meeting

*In attendance*: Mike, Amanda, Hytham, Demelza, Jan, Cole | *Absent*: Spencer

- Based on MNO feedback, we're willing to review any pitch decks we're sent, but have largely tabled any and all equity efforts pending what we'll call the "Professionalize the DIF" plan (more in "Administrative Meeting" below)
- Regarding the reserves re-balancing, we've placed our first round of gold buy orders. These are based on certain price ratios of Dash/gold, and so they will remain only orders until certain price ratios are "triggered," which could happen at any time
- We're communicating with Mark Mason of the current "Dash Newsroom" treasury proposal to prepare PR materials surrounding the DIF's gold buy to be published if/when our orders are met

# ADMINISTRATIVE Meeting

*In attendance*: Mike, Amanda, Hytham, Spencer, Jan, Cole | *Absent*: none

- Based on extensive MNO feedback about the failure of the DIF's last two proposals, Chair Mike Lewis has composed an internal memo regarding the need to now "Professionalize the DIF."
- Said memo outlines a plan of a multi-month (and potentially multi-year) timeline that changes the DIF from its current form (which is a volunteer committee acting as operators) to a professional form (which would be employed professionals with operational qualifications/experience). This would return the supervisors to their originally anticipated role of overseeing operations only.
- Formation of this plan and its timeline begins next week
