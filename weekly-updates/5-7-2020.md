# INVESTMENT Meeting

*In attendance*: Mike, Amanda, Hytham, Demelza, Spencer, Cole, Jan

*Absent*: none

- DCG CEO Ryan Taylor has kindly taken the initiative to contact an exchange that initially rejected the DIF. Taylor sees that their AML department has fundamentally misunderstood the DIF's source of funds, and has composed a thorough explanatory letter that can be re-used in future attempts to open accounts elsewhere, as well.

- DIF Chair Mike Lewis has, as part of the "Professionalize the DIF" plan, edited and proposed the addition of several documents, some of which originated in the [Bloomberg Beta Fund](https://github.com/Bloomberg-Beta), from which the DIF's repo was forked. 

- Consultant Demelza Hays is finalizing her instructions to the supervisors and directors for utilization of the Bitcoin Suisse account, as well as best practices for if/when the Vaultoro gold buys are triggered.

- Here is April 2020's [Fund Fact Sheet](https://github.com/DashInvests/dif-communication/blob/master/April%202020%20fund%20fact%20sheet%20DIF.jpg)
